# Online-Meta-Adaptive-Control-OMAC-Algorithm

These codes are based on the Online Meta-Adaptive Control (OMAC) algorithm proposed in the work "Meta-Adaptive Nonlinear Control: Theory and Algorithms".

Please run `experiments.ipynb`, where we provide several instantiations of OMAC in a nonlinear pendulum model with external wind disturbance, gravity mismatch, and unknown damping.
